# AI-Driven Data Insights – CLI Tool

This is a command-line tool for extracting insights from JSON files using OpenAI's GPT models. Designed for data professionals who prefer automation and precision in data exploration.

## Overview

The application enables users to:
- Upload and analyze structured JSON files
- Receive intelligent summaries generated by GPT-3.5
- Ask additional questions based on the file's contents
- Operate securely with environment-based API configuration

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaronkj/ai-driven-data-insights.git
cd ai-driven-data-insights
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your API key in a `.env` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

Ensure that `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`.

## Usage

```bash
python app.py path/to/file.json
```

You will receive a summary of the content. Optionally, you can input a follow-up question directly in the terminal to retrieve further insight.

## Example

```
--- AI Summary ---
